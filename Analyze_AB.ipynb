    "\n",
    "**Probability based approach:**\n",
    "- p(be converted | treatment group) is 0.118\n",
    "- p(be converted | control group) is 0.12\n",
    "- there is very slightly difference between both groups and proportion to be converted to new page design this is an evidence for there is a difference between statastical signficance and practical signficance here we have statastical signficance as both numbers are different while there is no practical signficance as this difference may be due to novelty issues or due to randomness\n",
    "\n",
    "**A/B test:**\n",
    "  - We simulated our user groups with respect to conversions and the p_value to be 0.905 With such a p-value, we failed to     reject null hypothesis\n",
    "  - Z-score of **1.3109** is less than the critical value of **1.6448**. So, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Regression Approach:**\n",
    "  - After we run our regression analysis we found that p-value is 0.19 which is higher than p-value we define before run      regression which is 0.05 so we can't reject null hypothesis\n",
    "  - finally we run regression after adding country in our consideration to figure out if diversity in countries affect our results and i found that p-values for **UK and USA** are 0.074 and 0.129 respectively which also greater than critical p-values to be said country variable affect our results and decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consideration:**\n",
    "  - These inferences and decision based on data we have so if we have another dataset for longer time this may affect our test and hypothesis or has other variables or attributes this may affect final results.\n",
