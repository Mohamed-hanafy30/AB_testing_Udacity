    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the framework this project, we tried to understand whether the company should implement a new page or keep the old page with following:\n",
    "- Probability based approach\n",
    "- A/B test\n",
    "- Regression approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability based approach:**\n",
    "- Given that an individual was in the treatment group, the probability they converted is 0.118807\n",
    "- Given that an individual was in the control group, the probability they converted is 0.120386\n",
    "- We find that old page does better, but by a very tiny margin.\n",
    "- Change aversion, test span durations and other potentially influencing factors are not accounted for. So, we cannot state with certainty that one page leads to more conversions. This is even more important due to almost similar perforamnce of both pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A/B test:**\n",
    "  - We simulated our user groups with respect to conversions\n",
    "  - We found the p_value to be 0.8879\n",
    "  - With such a p-value, we failed to reject null hypothesis\n",
    "  - We find that the z-score of 1.3109 is less than the critical value of 1.6448. So, we accept the null hypothesis.\n",
    "  - As regards the conversion rates of the old and new pages, we find that old pages are only minutely better than new pages.\n",
    "  - These values agree with the findings in parts j. and k.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Regression Approach:**\n",
    "  - We looked at exploring two possible outcomes. Whether new page is better or not.\n",
    "  - With logistic regression results, we again encountered same z-score as well as p-value of 0.190, corresponding two-tailed case\n",
    "  - Adding geographic location of the users, we tried to find if any specific country had an impact on conversion\n",
    "  - The result gave a similar outlook and suggested that the countries have no impact on the conversion rate.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Consideration:**\n",
    "  - These inferences are strictly based on data on hand. This analysis acknowledges its limitations due to factors not included in the data. \n",
    "  - We also looked at the duration of the experiment (21 days).This is a relatively short period of time to run the A/B test.\n",
