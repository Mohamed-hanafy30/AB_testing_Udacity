    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to understand whether the company should implement a new page or keep the old page with following approaches:\n",
    "- Probability based approach\n",
    "- A/B test\n",
    "- Regression approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability based approach:**\n",
    "- Given that an individual was in the treatment group, the probability they converted is 0.118807\n",
    "- Given that an individual was in the control group, the probability they converted is 0.120386\n",
    "- We find that old page does better, but by a very tiny margin.\n",
    "- Change aversion, test span durations and other potentially influencing factors are not accounted for. So, we cannot state with certainty that one page leads to more conversions. This is even more important due to almost similar perforamnce of both pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A/B test:**\n",
    "  - We simulated our user groups with respect to conversions and the p_value to be 0.905 With such a p-value, we failed to     reject null hypothesis\n",
    "  - Z-score of **1.3109** is less than the critical value of **1.6448**. So, we fail to reject null hypothesis.\n",
    "  - The conversion rates of the old and new pages, we find that old pages are only minutely better than new pages.\n",
    "  - These values agree with the findings in parts j. and k. and from statastics point of view they are different but from           pracitcal point of view they are don't\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Regression Approach:**\n",
    "  - We looked at exploring two possible outcomes. Whether new page is better or not.\n",
    "  - With logistic regression results, we again encountered same z-score as well as p-value of 0.190\n",
    "  - Adding geographic location of the users, we tried to find if any specific country had an impact on conversion the result       gave suggested that the countries have no impact on the conversion rate due to high p-value in second regression model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**HINT:** \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part II, the p-value was calculated where the null hypothesis was that the new page would convert more than the old page, and the alternative was the old page converted more than or equal to the new page.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Part III, we used variables, and used a linear model to determine the p-value. The null hypothesis was that the difference between the pages is equal to 0, and the alternative hypothesis was the difference between the pages is greater or less than 0.\n",
    " so this make difference in value of p-value but both tend to same conclusion there is no practical signficance between old and new page \n",
    " \n",
    "**Consideration:**\n",
    "  - These inferences are strictly based on data on hand.\n",
    "  - This analysis acknowledges its limitations due to factors not included in the data. \n",
    "  - We also looked at the duration of the experiment (21 days).This is a relatively short period of time to run the A/B test.\n",
