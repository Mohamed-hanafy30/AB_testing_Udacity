Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.\n",

This will assure you are on the right track as you work through the project, and you can feel more confident in your final submission meeting the criteria.  As a final check, assure you meet all the criteria on the [RUBRIC](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric).\n",

    "After doing our analysis using three different approaches we take the same decision but each model gernerate different result for example the difference between result in part 2 and part 3 due to difference in Hypotheses we stated this need a good interpretation skills to figure out model result in a good way in addition to the last part after we did regression taking in our consideration diversity due to country we have same results and reject null hypothes due to large p values for CANDA which is 0.074 and US which is 0.456.\n",

    "**Difference between statistical reasoning and practical reasoning**\n",
    "However in each one of approaches there is a very very slight difference between probability for each group and page design but this difference from statistics point of view is significant but practically not we have to further investigate it this may occurs due to random chance but not due to a reasonable effects.\n"
